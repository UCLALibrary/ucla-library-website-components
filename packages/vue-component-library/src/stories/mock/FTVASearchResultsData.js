    aboutTheAuthor: '<p>The annual Congress of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) usually starts with a two day symposium on some subject of interest to the delegates from as many as 160 different countries. This year’s symposium, organized by the China Film Archive in Beijing on April 22 and 23 considered the history and preservation of animation. On the first day there were a variety of speakers, including Japanese, French and Chinese animation specialists. The keynote was delivered by the director of the Tokyo Film Center, Mr. Hisashi Okajima, who gave an impassioned talk about his childhood love affair with animation, both in the cinema and on television.</p>\n<p>Jez Stewart, the animation curator at the British Film Institute in London reported on the BFI’s acquisition of the massive Bachelor and Halas Collection. John Halas was a Hungarian animator who emigrated to Britain just prior to World War II, then married fellow animator Joy Bachelor. Best known for their feature, <em>Animal Farm</em> (1954), the Halas &amp; Bachelor studio created over 2,000 animated films for commercials, industrials, television and experimental films. The daughter has now donated all the papers and films to the London archive and they are in the process of cataloguing and assessing the collection. My ears pricked up, because I know Saul Bass also worked with Halas &amp; Bachelor.</p>\n<p><img class="dropshadow" title="Mafish Fayda (1936)" src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/mish-mish.jpg" alt="Mafish Fayda (1936)" align="left" /></p>\n<p>I was also particularly interested in Eric LeRoy\'s talk. The Director of the French Centre National du Cinéma et de l’Image Animée introduced the Frenkel Brothers from Cairo, who apparently in the 1930s and 1940s made a whole series of cartoons with an Egyptian character named Mish Mish Effendi. David, Solomon and Herschel Frenkel had emigrated from Belorussia to Jaffa with their parents, and then to Cairo, where they operated a successful furniture factory turning out antique Chinese lacquered cabinets by day, and drawing animated films at night. <em>Mafish Fayda</em> opened in February 1936 and began a successful series with Mish Mish that resembled the Fleischer Brothers animation style, but with plenty of local color. They then emigrated to France in 1951, after the Palestine war of 1948 made it impossible to stay in Cairo, and continued to produce animated films in the 1950s, completing their final film, <em>Dream of the Blue Danube</em>, in 1964.</p>\n<p><img class="dropshadow" title="Cowboy\'s Flute (1963)" src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/cowboys-flute.jpg" alt="Cowboy\'s Flute (1963)" align="right" /></p>\n<p>Another Japanese speaker, Akira Tochigi, spoke of Japanese animation in the 1930s, which was a precursor to modern anime. In the evening we went to a screening where we actually got to see a bunch of these Japanese films and I certainly saw how the “Hello Kitty” aesthetic originated. My particular favorite was <em>The Spider and the Tulip </em>(1933), which was a very cute cat-and-mouse game between a spider (unfortunately in blackface) and a cute little ladybug who doesn’t want to end up as lunch. But the real surprise of the evening screenings were the Chinese animated films by Te Wei, which were wonderfully lyrical, incorporating traditional Chinese bamboo painting into their style. Both <em>Ju Di</em> (1963), about a boy playing a flute on a water buffalo and an earlier film about tadpoles looking for their mother, <em>Where’s Mama</em> (1960), had an amazing sense of nature, despite the simplicity of the animation.</p>\n<p>The second day of the FIAF Symposium was not quite as interesting as the first—except of course for Mark Quigley\'s very well-organized presentation on UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive’s <strong><a href="http://animation.library.ucla.edu">silent film animation webpage</a></strong>—but still very worthwhile. Mark had his challenges, because the Chinese internet wouldn\'t actually let him access the webpage—VERBOTEN—but he managed well with frame grabs. My favorite presentation of the day was by two archivists from the Polish National Archives in Warsaw, Tadeusz Kowalski and Elzbieta Wysocka, who presented the animated films of Julian Jozef Antonisz. In the 1960s and 1970s he made cameraless animated films by drawing on clear film leader, scratching images on the film, filling in the scratches with shoe polish, then hand coloring (his wife did that). In order to make the process more efficient, he invented a machine that would allow him to draw on a regular piece of frame and an arm would scratch the same image on 24 separate frames at the same time. The kicker was this "machine" was patched together out of old nails, balsa wood and other metal scraps he found on the street since he was not supported by the state (these were communist times) and had no money. The Poles are preserving the contraptions along with the films, which are being digitized.</p>\n<p><img class="dropshadow" title="What Do We See After Closing Our Eyes? (1978)" src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/closing-eyes.jpg" alt="What Do We See After Closing Our Eyes? (1978)" align="right" /></p>\n<p>Victor de Fochts from the Royal Belgian Film Archive also contributed an interesting talk on the origins of Belgian animation, including <em>Tintin</em>, which turns out to be a very popular comic book series, long before Spielberg. And there were two presentations on Emile Reynaud and Jacque Demeney, two French pre-cinema pioneers, with both speakers arguing that animation predates cinema and film should therefore be considered a subset of animation and not vice versa.</p>\n<p>There were also film screenings every night for the a whole week of the Congress, which were extremely well attended by very young Chinese audiences, but unfortunately other Congress business kept me away.</p>',

    aboutTheAuthor: '<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/HuntingTigersIndia.jpg" alt="" height="340" width="480" /></p>\n<p>If you watch television news, you’ve probably noticed the ever more intense urgency with which the PSAs of wildlife organizations are pleading with the public to save snow leopards, elephants, and other wildlife. That same advocacy can be seen in animal documentaries, but with a difference. For more than 100 years, filmed images of the natural world conformed to the classic documentary aesthetic. Such images were perceived to be an expansion of human vision, a means of entering into a world that was invisible to the human eye, an extension of the physical body of the viewer, allowing for the creation of pleasure by bringing animals in their natural habitat closer to humans. And while the visualization of animal life entailed particular narrative conventions that also communicated overt and covert ideologies, as is the case with all documentary forms, audiences still believed in the iconic nature of that experience. We are now observing a paradigm shift in the use of wildlife films. Today, the impulse to document nature is augmented by the much higher-stakes endeavor of “preserving” animal life in a virtual world. Looking over the precipice of an earth depopulated of its wildlife, the goal of nature filmmakers becomes the capture of animals in images. Every moving image can potentially be the last “living” image of a species, in the truest sense of the word.</p>\n<p>We can compare this phenomenon in the natural world to the work of Edward S. Curtis, the photographer and documentary filmmaker who made it his duty to document Native American cultures in North America before they became extinct. Curtis was convinced of his mission to photochemically preserve a “dying race” through images. Human societies living close to nature were indeed the first victims of modernization and the capitalist exploitation of natural resources, although Native Americans are far from extinct.</p>\n<p>Soon, our culture may possibly only see wild animals virtually or in special game reserves and zoo. Michel Foucault in a lecture defined zoological and botanical gardens as “heterotopias.” In these “other spaces,” whether real or virtual, as in wildlife films, wildlife has been collected ordered, and systematized “to create a space that is other, another real space, as perfect, as meticulous, as well arranged as ours is messy, ill constructed, and jumbled.”</p>\n<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/muybridge2.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></p>\n<p>Eadward Muybridge circa 1887.</p>\n<p>As a casual subject of moving images, animals have been present ever since Eadweard Muybridge photographed his animal locomotion series. Yet within classical documentary forms, animals have seemingly remained confined to the scientific and educational sphere, only intermittently the subject of a mainstream theatrical experience. With the introduction of television and cable, with its insatiable demand for content, wildlife documentaries have become ever more popular and ever more numerous. Countless animal film festivals are in operation these days, giving animal lovers, ecology freaks, and the moviegoing public an opportunity to commune with nature. The production of animal films for television has expanded with the establishment of cable channels, e.g. Animal Planet, National Geographic, and Discovery. These networks broadcast animal documentaries almost 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>In crass opposition to the insatiable fascination that viewers bring to the experience of viewing wildlife films, the rate at which animals are becoming extinct is accelerating; they’re victims of a civilization that places little value on natural habitats. The quicker humanity ruins the natural environment through deforestation and the establishment of urban centers in previously untouched areas, the more rapidly certain species expire. According to the ongoing surveys of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the so-called “Red Lists,” more than 16,119 species are threatened with extinction, including 1,003 kinds of mammals, i.e. 20%. Also endangered are 31% of all amphibians, 12% of all bird species, 4% of all reptiles, and 4% of all fish. In the United States, 236 animal species have already become extinct. Particularly at risk are our closest relatives in the animal world, the primates: of the world’s 296 primate species, 114 are critically endangered.</p>\n<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/AnimalPlanet.jpg" alt="" height="430" width="700" /></p>\n<p>One can therefore legitimately ask whether the growing obsession to document visually the animal world isn’t at least partially a desperate act to “save” wildlife for a virtual world. Certainly an appeal to viewers to actively participate in preserving the natural environment is a narrative element in many modern wildlife documentaries, but these are usually depoliticized, calling for individual action, rather than social struggle. The urgency with which “the end of nature” is present in the master narratives of many recent wildlife documentaries indicates that the worst fears of humanity are no longer unthinkable and may even become a reality. Animal film producers are seemingly preparing the public for the day when all wildlife will merely be seen in zoos, wildlife reserves, aquaria or virtually as moving images.</p>\n<p>With the Trump administration’s wholesale assault on the environment and its opening of wildlife preserves to commercial activity, this trend will only accelerate.</p>\n<h5><a href="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/archival-spaces"><br />&lt; Back to Archival Spaces blog</a></h5>\n<p> </p>',

He is a former studio executive with Nickelodeon Movies and Disney. He has curated cartoons for DVD and Blu-ray compilations and has lent his expertise to dozens of bonus documentaries and audio commentaries. Beck teaches animation history at CalArts, UCLA and Woodbury University, and serves as Vice President of the International Animated Film Society, ASIFA-Hollywood.<br /><br /></em></p>\n<p>After the enforcement of the Production Code in 1934, Max Fleischer’s animation studio had to rethink the direction of their Betty Boop cartoons. The character was still popular and iconic, but they had to downplay her sex appeal, and proceeded to give her an extended family that included her pet dog, Pudgy, a boyfriend, Freddie, and Grampy, an inventor.</p>\n<p>They also introduced a mischievous niece, Buzzy Boop. Unfortunately, her two film appearances in 1938 have been missing for over 70 years. The good news: a 35mm print of <em>Buzzy Boop at the Concert</em> was found in the Russian state film archive, Gosfilmofond, thanks to a group of animation buffs in Moscow.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/buzzyboop-blog4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></p>\n<p>This came about thanks to animator Fydor Khitruk. Khitruk was a fan of the 1980 book by Leonard Maltin, <em>Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons</em>, and felt it should be translated into Russian. He and his team of students spent a decade translating the book. Unfortunately, Khitruk passed away in 2012. His team then spent another six years completing the project, and the book was indeed published in Russia in 2018.</p>\n<p>Copies of the Russian version were sent to Leonard Maltin and myself (I was a research associate for <em>Of Mice and Magic</em>), and communication was established with the students. They read a post of mine about several “lost” Fleischer cartoons and decided to search Gosfilmofond for some of those titles. Miraculously, they found one of them hiding there—a pristine 35mm print of <em>Buzzy Boop at the Concert</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://www.asifa-hollywood.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Animated Film Society, ASIFA-Hollywood</a> (of which I am Vice President and am in charge of their film preservation activities) teamed with the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive to borrow that print, preserve and restore it, and make it available in the United States. The restoration debuted at the <a href="/events/2022/ucla-festival-of-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 UCLA Festival of Preservation</a> and is now available for viewing on the Archive’s <a href="https://youtu.be/jhIDjS61RU4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a> (watch below).</p>\n<p><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/buzzyboop-blog5.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></p>\n<p>In <em>Buzzy Boop at the Concert</em>, Betty Boop exposes her bored niece Buzzy to high culture by bringing her to a concert recital by a famed soprano supreme, Madame Shrill. Buzzy enlivens the concert, and awakens a dozing audience, by jazz dancing her way to the stage and rocking the whole joint. The highlight of the film is the crazy swing dance finale—as only the Fleischer studio can do it.</p>\n<p>The history of animation, and the larger history of film itself, is a giant jigsaw puzzle that historians and archivists race to put back together again. With lost films prior to 1950 printed on volatile nitrate stock, that race is getting harder and harder every year. The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive and their friends at ASIFA-Hollywood are committed to finding those lost jigsaw puzzle pieces—the cartoon ones—one “boop” at a time.</p>\n<p>Why preservation animation? “Animated films are art, and art has value,” says ASIFA-Hollywood Executive Director Frank Gladstone. “They are often reflective of their times, a window into what people thought about when they were made. They are history. How can we understand where we are going or how we might get there unless we know where we have already been? And, as Jerry often says, if we don’t do this, who will?”<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Watch <em>Buzzy Boop at the Concert</em> (1938):</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive with</em><em> funding provided by ASIFA-Hollywood. </em><br /><em>Laboratory services by Roundabout Entertainment, Inc., Audio Mechanics, DJ Audio, Inc., FotoKem.<br />Special thanks to Gosfilmofond, Stanislav Dedinsky, Natalie Ryabchikova, Paramount Pictures Archives.</em></p>\n<h5><br /><a href="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/archive-blog">&lt; Back to the Archive Blog</a></h5>\n<p> </p>',

The Fleischer cartoons were always imaginative and filled with hilarious ideas, but this may top them all. KoKo and Fitz find their way to the top of the world and enter a building that houses the “Control of Earth.” While KoKo plays with the controls for Rain, Day and Night, Fitz tempts fate and pulls a control handle that will destroy the planet. Soon, all hell breaks loose — not only in the cartoon world, but out of the inkwell itself: in the live-action real world. Manhattan is submerged, KoKo reverts to an ink puddle. Just another day at Fleischer Studios — a hilarious vision of the end of the world as we know it.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/kokoblog2.png" alt="" width="600" height="430" /></p>\n<p>Watch online:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Sinbad the Sailor (1935) </strong></p>\n<p>Ub Iwerks, the “hand behind the mouse,” designer and animator of Mickey Mouse, parted with Walt Disney in 1930 to create cartoon series for MGM, and later assorted shorts for other studios, during that decade. Between 1934 and 1936, Iwerks studio produced a series of “ComiColor” musical cartoon shorts for distributor Pat Powers. Each one was of a different subject — usually a fairy tale, nursery rhyme or a legendary storybook character — not unlike Disney’s “Silly Symphonies.” Iwerks’ crew included famous animators such as Grim Natwick and Frank Tashlin, as well as musical scores by Carl Stalling. This particular short is an action-packed adventure, with lots of thrilling adventures and visual delights. It also makes great use of a limited color palette provided by the two-color Cinecolor process.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/sinbad-blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="430" /></p>\n<p>Watch online:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy (1941) </strong></p>\n<p>In the wake of the successful animated feature releases by Walt Disney (<em>Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs</em>) and Max Fleischer (<em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>) in 1937 and 1939, respectively, Paramount immediately authorized the production a pair of extra-length two-reel cartoon subjects from Fleischer Studios. The first one, released in April 1941, was produced at Fleischer’s lavish new animation studio in Miami, Florida, where the production of <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> took place, alongside the popular <em>Popeye</em> shorts and pre-production on their second feature, <em>Mr. Bug Goes To Town</em> (1941). Based on the classic books by Johnny Gruelle, Fleischer fashioned <em>Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy</em> as a musical taking place in the imagination of a little girl. The studio changed the relationship of Ann and Andy from brother and sister to boyfriend and girlfriend to give the story more drama. The book’s popular Camel with the Wrinkled Knees makes an appearance, voiced by Pinto Colvig (better known as Disney’s Goofy). Al J. Neiburg, Dave Fleischer and Sammy Timberg wrote four catchy original songs. It’s a delightful film — and the Paramount animation department (known after 1942 as Famous Studios) made two sequels in 1944 and 1947.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/raggedy-blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="430" /></p>\n<p>Watch online:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>A Hatful of Dreams (1944)</strong></p>\n<p>One of the wonderful Technicolor George Pal “Puppetoons,” a unique series of stop-motion shorts released by Paramount between 1941 and 1947. Animator Pal won a Special Academy Award for this series, for its “novel methods” of three-dimensional cartoon making — today known as “replacement animation,” a technique widely used in films such as <em>Coraline</em> and TV productions like <em>Robot Chicken</em>. Before Pal’s illustrious career as a live-action fantasy filmmaker (<em>War of the Worlds</em>, <em>Tom Thumb</em>, <em>The Time Machine</em>, among others), he produced Puppetoon shorts like this one, starring Rusty, a little boy with a big imagination. This short utilizes Paramount’s exclusive arrangement with National Periodicals (DC Comics) for its use of Superman, whom Rusty imagines himself to be in his daydream. The art direction and character designs, as well as the models, sets and the lighting, are dazzling — noteworthy for their originality.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/hatful-blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="430" /></p>\n<p>Watch online:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>—edited by Jennifer Rhee, Digital Content Manager<br /><br /></em></p>\n<h5><a href="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/archive-blog">&lt; Back to the Archive Blog<br /></a></h5>\n<p> </p>',

    aboutTheAuthor: '<p><em><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/FYS-blog-crop.png" alt="" width="480" height="340" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Freight Yard Symphony </em>(1963)<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Visual effects and motion graphics pioneer Robert Abel (1937-2001) began his career apprenticing with noted computer animation pioneer John Whitney Sr. and working with design giants Charles Eames and Saul Bass. Abel\'s creative arts training also included a fine arts degree in film and design at UCLA. These key mentors and experiences proved to be central influences in Abel\'s acclaimed experimental animated UCLA short, <em>Freight Yard Symphony</em> (1963). Abel\'s highly accomplished, original student workshop film utilizes bold graphics syncopated to a jazz score to present an evocative, expressionist take on the colors, movements and rhythms of a commercial rail yard. An important work in the development of a major visual communication arts figure, Abel\'s <em>Freight Yard Symphony</em> was selected by the Council on International Non-theatrical Events (CINE) to represent the U.S. in foreign film festivals in 1964.</p>\n<p>Prominent animation historian and Cal Arts professor Jerry Beck (author of the reference book, <em>The Animated Movie Guide</em>, Chicago Review Press, 2005) notes that Abel\'s five-minute color film, <em>Freight Yard Symphony</em>, “demonstrates [Abel\'s] early thought process and employs a unique point of view on visual storytelling. Innovative use of cut-out animation, combining original artwork and photo collage; the film is an experiment on how to use graphics, music and camera movement to express ideas and immerse the viewer.” As Beck indicates, Abel\'s highly stylized mixed media approach appropriates seemingly banal objects, such as a printed waybill of goods or rail yard signs, and incorporates them into a fast-paced sequence of imagery that distills the kinetic energy of a busy industrial train depot into bold, yet simple graphic elements. Defined by Piet Mondrian-inspired lines and Oskar Fischinger-style movement, the short evokes later animated title sequences by Saul Bass and the experimental films of Ray and Charles Eames. Abel\'s film represents not only an example of the advancement of emerging modernist animation styles popularized by such studios as United Productions of America (UPA) at mid-century, but also serves as a record of the dynamic output of the influential UCLA film school at a critical juncture in its early development.</p>\n<p><img src="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/robert-abel-blog-crop.png" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></p>\n<p>Robert Abel<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Following his training at UCLA and the Bauhaus school in Ulm, Germany, Robert Abel went on to become one of the founding fathers of advanced computer graphics-based animation, contributing his distinctive creative talents to groundbreaking network television identification campaigns (utilizing state-of-the art slit-scan effects), as well as innumerable award-winning TV commercials. The recipient of two Emmy Awards for his documentary work (including one for co-directing <em>The Making of The President: 1968</em>) and over 30 Clio Awards for advertising, Abel and his renowned firm, Robert Abel &amp; Associates, is perhaps best remembered for the kaleidoscopic 7UP “Bubbles” ad, one of the most visually impressive and technically accomplished television commercials of the 1970s. Abel\'s long list of achievements also includes innovative computer animated sequences for the Walt Disney Studio motion pictures, <em>Tron</em> (1982) and <em>The Black Hole</em> (1979). In an interview reprinted in Communication Arts in 2005, Abel summed up his creative career: “The essence of what I do is that I take risks.... That\'s what film and special effects are all about. Every time I set out to do a project, I go out to do something never done or seen before.” Abel died of a heart attack in Los Angeles in 2001 at age 64. His influential work continues to be lauded by visual media historians today.</p>\n<p>See our <a href="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/robert-abel-associates">Robert Abel &amp; Associates collection profile</a> to view a sample list of titles available for on-site research (when the Archive Research and Study Center reopens).</p>\n<p><em>Freight Yard Symphony </em><span>was restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive with funding provided by the National Film Preservation Foundation.

The term describes a wide range of frame-by-frame, two and three dimensional filmmaking techniques. Animation processes include the manipulation of drawings on clear acetate sheets (cels) or paper, cutouts, puppets, clay and models. Other techniques include pin screen animation, photokinesis, pixilation and computer-generated imagery. Animated films have entertained and educated, and sold products, and artists have used the techniques to give motion to purely abstract shapes. In recent years, animation has become the subject of serious critical examination.</p>\n<p>The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive collections contain examples of virtually all types of animation. Among the holdings are over sixty animated films by Dave Fleischer, independent films by Ub Iwerks (one of the inventors of Mickey Mouse), and a large selection of <strong><a href="collections/warner-brothers">Warner Brothers</a></strong> cartoons, featuring both the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Other parts of the collection include animated commercials, movie trailers and episodes of "The Simpsons" and "Sesame Street," as well as works by artists such as Fernand Leger and films developed in the UCLA Animation Workshop. A study collection on video, donated by ASIFA-Hollywood (L\'Association Internationale du Film d\'Animation), provides an overview of the field. The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive\'s ongoing preservation program, which works to save film from nitrate deterioration, has restored the early color Betty Boop cartoon "Poor Cinderella," some <strong><a href="collections/hearst-collection">Hearst Newsreel</a></strong> animation and <a href="http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/george-pal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>George Pal</strong></a> Puppetoons.</p>\n<h4 class="sectioncolor">View films online: Silent Animation Preserved at UCLA</h4>\n<figure><img class="dropshadow" title="Bob\'s Electric Theatre (1906)" src="sites/default/files/Bobs_Electric_Theatre.jpg" alt="Bob\'s Electric Theatre (1906)" width="389" height="266" /></figure>\n<p>Thanks to an access grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation, UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive has launched an interactive website showcasing select animated films preserved at UCLA. Although best-known for the restoration of feature films, UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive has been preserving animated films for more than three decades, with over one hundred animation titles preserved to date. The animated short subjects presented in the Archive\'s online portal at <strong><a href="http://animation.library.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animation.library.ucla.edu</a></strong> provide a representative sampling of that work from the silent era, preserved from best-surviving and sole-surviving 35mm nitrate and 16mm prints.</p>\n<p>Visitors to the Archive\'s website may view or download eleven films originating from 1900 to 1928, including titles such as J. Stuart Blackton\'s <em>The Enchanted Drawing</em> (1900) and a promotional film for Harry O. Hoyt\'s <em>The Lost World</em> (1925). Audio track options to accompany the silent films include traditional piano and experimental scores by composer Michael Mortilla, as well as voice-over commentary by the Archive\'s Senior Film Preservationist, Jere Guldin. To provide additional context for the works, the site features film notes by Guldin and animation historian, Jerry Beck ("The Animated Movie Guide"), and an original essay, "Animation\'s Early Years" by historian Mark Langer (Carleton University). The site also includes a study guide that serves as an introduction the Archive\'s broader collection of animation, much of it accessible for research via the <strong><a href="education/research-archive">Archive Research and Study Center (ARSC)</a></strong> located on the UCLA campus.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Watch "The Fascinating History of Animation," presented by the Archive\'s Mark Quigley:</strong></p>\n<figure><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gfH-NLo8tRk?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>\n<h5><strong><a href="collections/collection-profiles"><br />&lt; Back to Collection Profiles<br /><br /></a></strong></h5>',

This collection is complemented by Lantz\' professional and business papers held at UCLA\'s Arts-Special Collections and Music Libraries.</p><p>Walter Lantz was born into an immigrant Italian family in New Rochelle, New York. A newspaper cartoonist during his teens, he became an animator with Gregory La Cava and then worked with the animation pioneers at Bray Studios. In the late twenties he moved to Hollywood, landing a job with Universal Pictures. In 1935 he started his own production company, striking a deal with Universal to provide cartoons on a regular basis. Five years later, Walter Lantz Productions became a completely independent company. Eventually, its activities expanded to other areas such as television and the merchandising of cartoon-related products.</p><p>Lantz created many popular cartoon characters, including the bird with the trademark laugh, Woody Woodpecker. UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive holds more than twenty-five of Walter Lantz\' cartoon shorts, spanning the early 1930s to the 1960s. Many of the titles from the 1940s feature the Woody Woodpecker character.</p><p>At Arts-Special Collections the Walter Lantz Archive (1940-1979) is available for research. It consists of 350 boxes, divided into three main areas. Part I contains animation cels and models, storyboards and backgrounds. Part II is devoted to production materials, including research materials and notes, scripts, treatments, storyboard sketches, cutting continuities and publicity materials (clippings, stills). Part III is a collection of comic books featuring Walter Lantz cartoon characters.</p><p>UCLA\'s Music Library holds the Walter Lantz Music Collection, containing scores, parts and detail sheets for Woody Woodpecker cartoons and various commercials. It also features popular sheet music for use as source material for productions.</p><p>To arrange onsite research viewing access, please contact the <strong><a href="education/research-archive">Archive Research and Study Center (ARSC)</a></strong>.</p><h5><strong><a href="collections/collection-profiles"><br />&lt; Back to Collection Profiles<br /><br /></a></strong></h5>',

This is a sentiment Rich has carried throughout his life. </p>\n<p>S. Torriano Berry, the director, writer, producer, editor, composer and star of <em>Rich</em>, completed the film in 1983 as his 477 Film II class project while a student in UCLA’s Department of Theater Arts. Rich arrived during the second decade of the UCLA student film movement known as the “L.A. Rebellion.” The film fits in with the stylistic and thematic traditions of many of its earlier peers, such as Charles Burnett’s celebrated <em>Killer of Sheep</em> (1977), while remaining unique in purpose and production. The film draws on characteristics of Italian Neorealism — an approach used by many L.A. Rebellion filmmakers — through its location shooting in Watts and, conceptually, its focus on social reality. A component of this is that there is a baseline of survival that is intrinsic to daily life and an emphasis on the experience — often only as spectators — of the youth through these realities. However, unlike the bleak futures portrayed in Italian Neorealist films, <em>Rich</em> is utterly hopeful.

A college degree in film studies is often seen as a frivolous and risky endeavor, yet the technical, creative and problem-solving skills gained from film school provide more than a surface-level ability to tell a story.

Working with the original A/B rolls, the film elements were inspected, prepared and scanned in-house.

Minor reconstruction of torn frames was also completed during this stage. Despite its age, the film remained in relatively good condition.

Lubin worked under the supervision of UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive staff to inspect, prepare, digitally restore and preserve the film In Transit. This internship was made possible by generous funding from the Myra Reinhard Family Foundation.<br /><br /></em></p>\n<p>In the summer of 2023, I had the chance to select and restore a student film as part of the UCLA Student Film Initiative Internship: The Present Preserving the Past. Among the variety of student films that were inspected, one title in particular, <em>In Transit: The Chinese in California</em> (1977), stood out to me. A blend of live-action scenes, animation and photo prints, the film uses myriad elaborate effects to merge these components together into a 24-minute documentary about the experiences of Chinese immigrants in California during the 19th and early 20th century. One thing that intrigued me about the film was how the credits reflected the activism taking place on campus and in the film program to enroll and support the work of students from diverse backgrounds. It even features narrations from founding members of the East West Players, one of the first Asian American theater organizations in Los Angeles: Beulah Quo, James Hong and Pat Li. In researching the title online, there was scarce information to be found about the film. The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive has three prints in their collection of <em>In Transit</em>, although the original elements which were held at the Deluxe Film Lab are unable to be located since the lab closed permanently. These are just a few of the factors that encouraged my selection of <em>In Transit</em>. Through details written on the original film can that had an address and telephone number, I was able to locate the filmmaker, Lilian Wu; we got in contact, and I had the opportunity to talk to her and learn more about the production history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/In_Transit_blog1.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>In Transit</em> took over three years to complete and was made at a time when the campus politics and student films were evolving. Initiatives — such as the creation of the Ethno-Communications Program (1969-73) by Elyseo Taylor within the film school and the establishment of the Asian American Studies Center (1969) — were part of this transformation that reflected the increasing student activism and artistic expression taking place across UCLA. Lilian Wu attended UCLA for most of the 1970s: she received a B.A. in theater in 1971 from the College of Fine Arts, an M.F.A. in film from the School of Theater, Film and Television in 1976, and an M.B.A. with the Graduate School of Management in 1979. And although the filmmaker herself was not actively a part of the student protests, she worked with many student filmmakers who have since been noted as influential figures in UCLA’s film school history and in what has become known as the L.A. Rebellion student film movement. I would argue that <em>In Transit</em> is directly reflective of the evolving campus, as more students were using filmmaking to their advantage as a platform for freedom of speech and to represent more diverse viewpoints.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/In_Transit_blog6.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The film\'s initial release was met with a mixed reception. In 1977, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reviewed <em>In Transit</em> as part of the <em>UCLA in Focus</em> film series, a program that screened nine student films. In its brief mention, the reviewer described the film as an “angry historical indictment of the prejudiced treatment of Chinese immigrants in California.” Lilian recalled that when the film was completed, her professor, Flora Mock, showed it to friends who were distributors, who told Mock that they would never be able to rent the film out because there wasn’t a balance of perspectives — according to them, it only featured the Asian point of view, and because of this the film wouldn’t do well in school districts. Contrary to those comments, the film was well received by Wu’s professors, who highly encouraged her to submit to festivals and distributors; <em>In Transit</em> won awards, in 1977, at the Chicago Film Festival and the Council of International Nontheatrical Events.</p>\n<p>Because<em> In Transit</em> involves the use of different elements such as older photo prints, there are some areas of the film that have pre-existing damage and dirt on the image itself. In my role as preservationist, I have aimed to keep the look of the film as close to the original version as possible because of the value in viewing the film as originally made. I feel that in keeping the prints as congruous to their original quality as possible, it allows the audience to interpret the historical qualities of the prints for themselves.</p>\n<p>I am tremendously grateful to Lilian Wu for sharing her time and input during the preservation of this title, and just as I have had the opportunity to this summer with the UCLA Student Film Initiative Internship, I hope that this contribution can help to broaden the public scope of what types of student films were being made at UCLA and how the subjects of those films transforming over the decades to reflect the social, artistic and cultural evolutions that were taking place on campus.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Watch <em>In Transit: The Chinese in California</em>:</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><br /><em>In Transit</em> storyboards by Lilian Wu provided by the filmmaker (click to enlarge):</strong></p>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_1.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_2.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_3.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_4.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bibliography: </p>\n<p>“Cine.” Wikipedia, January 29, 2023. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINE.%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINE. </a></p>\n<p>Gross, Linda.

It even features narrations from founding members of the East West Players, one of the first Asian American theater organizations in Los Angeles: Beulah Quo, James Hong and Pat Li. In researching the title online, there was scarce information to be found about the film. The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive has three prints in their collection of <em>In Transit</em>, although the original elements which were held at the Deluxe Film Lab are unable to be located since the lab closed permanently. These are just a few of the factors that encouraged my selection of <em>In Transit</em>. Through details written on the original film can that had an address and telephone number, I was able to locate the filmmaker, Lilian Wu; we got in contact, and I had the opportunity to talk to her and learn more about the production history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/In_Transit_blog1.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>In Transit</em> took over three years to complete and was made at a time when the campus politics and student films were evolving. Initiatives — such as the creation of the Ethno-Communications Program (1969-73) by Elyseo Taylor within the film school and the establishment of the Asian American Studies Center (1969) — were part of this transformation that reflected the increasing student activism and artistic expression taking place across UCLA. Lilian Wu attended UCLA for most of the 1970s: she received a B.A. in theater in 1971 from the College of Fine Arts, an M.F.A. in film from the School of Theater, Film and Television in 1976, and an M.B.A. with the Graduate School of Management in 1979. And although the filmmaker herself was not actively a part of the student protests, she worked with many student filmmakers who have since been noted as influential figures in UCLA’s film school history and in what has become known as the L.A. Rebellion student film movement. I would argue that <em>In Transit</em> is directly reflective of the evolving campus, as more students were using filmmaking to their advantage as a platform for freedom of speech and to represent more diverse viewpoints.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/In_Transit_blog6.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The film\'s initial release was met with a mixed reception. In 1977, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reviewed <em>In Transit</em> as part of the <em>UCLA in Focus</em> film series, a program that screened nine student films. In its brief mention, the reviewer described the film as an “angry historical indictment of the prejudiced treatment of Chinese immigrants in California.” Lilian recalled that when the film was completed, her professor, Flora Mock, showed it to friends who were distributors, who told Mock that they would never be able to rent the film out because there wasn’t a balance of perspectives — according to them, it only featured the Asian point of view, and because of this the film wouldn’t do well in school districts. Contrary to those comments, the film was well received by Wu’s professors, who highly encouraged her to submit to festivals and distributors; <em>In Transit</em> won awards, in 1977, at the Chicago Film Festival and the Council of International Nontheatrical Events.</p>\n<p>Because<em> In Transit</em> involves the use of different elements such as older photo prints, there are some areas of the film that have pre-existing damage and dirt on the image itself. In my role as preservationist, I have aimed to keep the look of the film as close to the original version as possible because of the value in viewing the film as originally made. I feel that in keeping the prints as congruous to their original quality as possible, it allows the audience to interpret the historical qualities of the prints for themselves.</p>\n<p>I am tremendously grateful to Lilian Wu for sharing her time and input during the preservation of this title, and just as I have had the opportunity to this summer with the UCLA Student Film Initiative Internship, I hope that this contribution can help to broaden the public scope of what types of student films were being made at UCLA and how the subjects of those films transforming over the decades to reflect the social, artistic and cultural evolutions that were taking place on campus.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Watch <em>In Transit: The Chinese in California</em>:</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><br /><em>In Transit</em> storyboards by Lilian Wu provided by the filmmaker (click to enlarge):</strong></p>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_1.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_2.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_3.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<figure><a href="/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/LWU_Storyboard_4.png" alt="" width="600" /></a></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bibliography: </p>\n<p>“Cine.” Wikipedia, January 29, 2023. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINE.%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINE. </a></p>\n<p>Gross, Linda.

    articleCategories: [],
    aboutTheAuthor: '<p><em><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/secondcampaign-blog1.jpeg" alt="" width="480" height="340" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Second Campaign </em>(1970)</p>\n<p><em>Our guest writer is <strong>Christina Scholze</strong>, a second year UCLA student in the Master of Library and Information Science degree program with a specialization in Media Archival Studies. Scholze worked under the supervision of UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive staff to inspect, prepare, digitally restore and preserve the film Second Campaign. This internship was made possible by generous funding from the Myra Reinhard Family Foundation.<br /><br /></em></p>\n<p>The student experience across the U.S. throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s was deeply embedded in the larger issues concerning the country — notably the anti-war movement, the fight for civil rights, women’s liberation and concerns over free speech. These topics were at the forefront of the University of California campuses, especially at UC Berkeley where the Free Speech Movement began in 1964. With the university becoming known for its political activism, then-Governor Ronald Reagan gave a <a href="https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/229317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a> in 1966 criticizing the “small minority of beatniks, radicals and filthy speech advocates that have brought shame on a great university.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/secondcampaign-blog5.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tensions came to a head in May 1969 over an undeveloped piece of UC property next to the Berkeley campus that had been transformed into a local park, known as People’s Park. After construction of the park began, the university announced plans to build a soccer field and proceeded to fence off and demolish the park. On May 15, an ongoing political rally moved off campus towards People’s Park, which in its occupation by police had come to represent growing free speech issues. In defending People’s Park, the crowd grew by several thousand and attempted to tear down the barricading fence. Violence ensued when officers used extreme force, resulting in several hundred injuries and one death, prompting Reagan to declare a State of Emergency and call on 2,000 National Guard members to secure the area. Amidst this conflict, UCLA film students Norman Yonemoto (1946–2014) and Nikolai Ursin (1942–1990) traveled to Berkeley to film the continuing protests, resulting in their documentary titled <em>Second Campaign</em>. </p>\n<p>In a 2011 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6ywGhT9SFE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with the Japanese American National Museum, Yonemoto recalled how “everybody thought there might be another riot ’cause it was very volatile.” What Yonemoto and Ursin found was something unexpected — moments of communal joy. The film begins on a humorous note and continues with more serious scenes shot in black and white, showcasing expected political action. They filmed speeches and rallying cries, tense and more casual interactions with the National Guard, interviews with community members, and debates between protesters and police. There are compelling scenes of a folk singer performing for a National Guard audience, revealing peaceful aspects of the protest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/secondcampaign-blog2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Towards the climax of the documentary, the tone shifts thematically and visually.

In his interview, Yonemoto emphasized the emotions of witnessing these moments develop when “cooler heads prevailed and it turned into a celebration of nothing in particular, just a celebration, a party.” Yonemonto continued, “at the time we made [the film] there was a nostalgia for the present,” perhaps referring to the tumultuous 1960s and the experiences of the younger generation. The film might reflect the desire to hold onto joyful moments amongst the turbulence.

Its unique perspective moves beyond polarizing differences and as Yonemoto says, “its political purpose sort of melts away” as you get deeper into the film, “and you\'re presented with a directly emotional and psychological viewpoint.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/secondcampaign-blog4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yonemoto and Ursin themselves make appearances in the documentary. Yonemoto (pictured above, right) is filmed interviewing bystanders, and we can hear the filmmakers’ voices identifying themselves and answering questions.

Norman Yonemoto (sound/editing), a prominent and innovative visual artist, grew up in the Bay Area and attended the UCLA Department of Theater Arts, now the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, as an undergraduate, receiving his M.F.A. from the American Film Institute in 1972.

It was very important to study notes left by the filmmakers on specific color choices to ensure the digital restoration matched Yonemoto and Ursin’s intentions.

Scholze worked under the supervision of UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive staff to inspect, prepare, digitally restore and preserve the film Second Campaign. This internship was made possible by generous funding from the Myra Reinhard Family Foundation.<br /><br /></em></p>\n<p>The student experience across the U.S. throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s was deeply embedded in the larger issues concerning the country — notably the anti-war movement, the fight for civil rights, women’s liberation and concerns over free speech. These topics were at the forefront of the University of California campuses, especially at UC Berkeley where the Free Speech Movement began in 1964. With the university becoming known for its political activism, then-Governor Ronald Reagan gave a <a href="https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/229317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a> in 1966 criticizing the “small minority of beatniks, radicals and filthy speech advocates that have brought shame on a great university.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src="https://cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/secondcampaign-blog5.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="430" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tensions came to a head in May 1969 over an undeveloped piece of UC property next to the Berkeley campus that had been transformed into a local park, known as People’s Park. After construction of the park began, the university announced plans to build a soccer field and proceeded to fence off and demolish the park. On May 15, an ongoing political rally moved off campus towards People’s Park, which in its occupation by police had come to represent growing free speech issues. In defending People’s Park, the crowd grew by several thousand and attempted to tear down the barricading fence. Violence ensued when officers used extreme force, resulting in several hundred injuries and one death, prompting Reagan to declare a State of Emergency and call on 2,000 National Guard members to secure the area.
