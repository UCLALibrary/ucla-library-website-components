The black and white cat was first spotted in 2015 near their namesake Powell Library, and soon became the campus’ informal mascot, immortalized with their own Instagram account, on t-shirts, stickers, buttons and even a cameo in a UCLA Library holiday card! The friendly feline captured students’ hearts and they shared their love and thanks at a memorial held on the steps of Powell Library on March 16. Here are a few of the hundreds of messages:</p>\n<p>Thank you for being there for me in a time when I needed it. | You were my pet away from home. Truly my comfort animal after a rough day of classes. | You’re the only cat I’ll sneeze for ♥ | Thank you for sitting on my lap when I was having a rough time. | Your legend will live forever. | Rest in peace Powell Cat ♥ We love you so much, Fly high!</p>\n<h3>Baby Giraffe Image Position: CENTER - Image-style: FULL WIDTH - Link: LINK EXTERNAL (NewTab)</h3>\n<figure class=\"image--center image--full\"><a href=\"https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Baby-Giraffe.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://static.library.ucla.edu/craftassetstest/Documents/giraffe_baby.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Giraffe Center\" /></a><figcaption>Baby Giraffe Position: CENTER - Image-style: FULL WIDTH - Link: LINK EXTERNAL (NewTab)</figcaption></figure><p>Giraffe babies are born with their eyes open, and look very much like miniature adults, but their little horns, called \"ossicones\" are folded flat against their head while they are inside the mother, and take a few hours to start to stand up straight.Both males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature. </p>\n<h3>Baby Giraffe Image.
